In computations.py, both the optimization and plot generation functions are included. 
You only have to run the file and wait for the optimization to complete. The figure shoould automatically appear will be saved as a pdf in the same folder.
Ofcourse you can still change the constraints of the parameters according to what you want!

multiple_isospectrum.py uses the same plot generating function.
It will takes some manual work if you want a new set of isospectral pairs. 
Save many figures from computations.py and manually put the parameters in "__main__" as you can see. 
The order of the parameters is shown as a comment.
For now, the default parameters are set to be what I used in the paper.
